Basic Ruby Exercises and Algorithm Concepts

##Install
`gem install minitest`

##Run the tests
`ruby <file_name>_spec.rb`

##Learning Goals
* Find multible ways to solve a problem in Ruby
* Get comfortable with basic programming concepts like Object Oriented Programming or Test Driven Development
* Write your own specs with Minitest
* Compare the speed of your methods with Minitest Benchmark
* Compare Recursion to Iteration
* Learn some (for interviews) useful Algorithms and Datastructures

##How to
1. Check out the test.rb and test_spec.rb files
2. Find exercises for your level.
3. If there are provided tests run them first and see them fail.
4. Write your method(s) and run the tests until all pass.
###You could also
* Add more tests to the spec file
* Test the speed of your methods 
* Find the shortest and fastest implementation for the problem you can think of
###Later
1. Find your own exercise
2. Write the test(s) first and see them fail. Think about edge cases like having default values, wrong classes as input or too small or large data.
3. Then write your methods and rund the tests again until all pass. Add testcases while you code, when you forgot one.
