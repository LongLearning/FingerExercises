The Bodyshop

Read: http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/oops/

A Bodyshop works on Vehicles. So lets build this class first. Initialize the class as general as possible.
Cars, Trucks and Motorcycles inherit from Vehicles. Set only what is different in these classes.
Make sure all of your Vehicles have wheels, doors, seats, condition, problem, date when they where made and an average lifespan. Each Vehicle should have a different value for the condition it is shiped. Age makes the basic conditon worse.

Create getter and setter for these values, a method which picks a problem from a predefined list randomly, another method that sets the condition depending on the problem the car has. This method should be aware of the pre-existing condition. Then there should be a method which asks if the car is too broken to fix and one if it's too old.

You could create the Problem as its own class, give it a name and make it know how long it takes to fix it depending on the type of Vehicle, like: if a Car needs x hours to get fixed, a Motocycle takes x/2 and a Truck 2x.

The Bodyshop has a certain ammount of Workstations. Each Workstation should be its own object. It knows when a vehicle is checked in. They are numbered, have a status 'in_use', 'needs_cleaning', 'broken', 'ready' and it takes a vehicle. It checks the time it needs to fix the Vehicle, makes sure it is worth repairing, takes a Mechanic, and send the car back to the bodyshop when its done with information 'repaired', 'too old' or 'too broken'.

The Bodyshop has a certain amount of machanics and Worstations. It takes cars, check Workstations for 'ready' and if there are mechanics who are not working right now. Then it assigns Vehicles to the Workstations and bill the owner depending on the kind of Problem they had and how long it took them to fix it. Then it sets the Vehicles Problem to nil.
